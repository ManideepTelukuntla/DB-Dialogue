## 1. Introduction/Overview
This project introduces a conversational chatbot capable of interpreting natural language queries, generating SQL queries accordingly, and fetching results from a SQL database. Leveraging OpenAI's GPT-4 for natural language processing and featuring a Streamlit-based GUI, it offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface for complex database interactions.

## 2. Features
- **Natural Language Processing**: Employs GPT-4 to understand and process user queries in natural language.
- **SQL Query Generation**: Dynamically constructs SQL queries based on natural language inputs.
- **Database Interaction**: Seamlessly connects with SQL databases to retrieve accurate query results.
- **Streamlit GUI**: Provides a simple and engaging user interface, making it accessible for individuals of all skill levels.

## 3. Architecture Overview
The chatbot architecture integrates GPT-4 for processing and understanding natural language inputs. It translates these inputs into SQL queries which are then executed against a SQL database to fetch results. The frontend is built using Streamlit, offering a clean and interactive interface for users. This setup demonstrates a practical application of combining AI with web technologies for database management.

## 5. File Descriptions
- **`Chat-With-SQL-Database-App.py`**: The main Python script that integrates GPT-4 for NLP, connects and runs the SQL query against MySQL database and handles the Streamlit GUI.
- **`chinook.db`**: This is the datbase utilized in this project, containing Digital Media Store data.
- - **`ChinookMySQL.sql`**: SQL file to create the chinook database.
- **`requirements.txt`**: Lists all the dependencies necessary for the project.
- **`Images`**: Contains images related to the project for documentation and UI design.

## 6. Conclusion
The Natural Language to SQL Chatbot represents a significant step forward in making database interactions more intuitive and accessible. By leveraging cutting-edge NLP technology and user-friendly GUI designs, it simplifies complex database queries, making it a valuable tool for users ranging from database administrators to those with minimal SQL expertise.
